# Bubble Sort
This another sorting algorithm similar to **Insertion Sort**. In this algorithm the idea is to check each consequetive elements and comparing them and swaping their position and start all over again untill the entire data is sorted.
It's has similar ** Time Complexity** of **O(n^2)** in the worest case like the Insertion sort, but it is slow in the average case compared to Insertion sort.
