# Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is a way of organizing data by sorting it in a proper manner or order.
The idea is to assume the first data of our input is sorted and we start from the second data and compare with the first one, if they are not in proper order we swap the two and continue to the third data and do the same until our data is properly organized.
