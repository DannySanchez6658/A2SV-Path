# Selection Sort
This is another sorting algorithm that is much simpler and better compared to bubble sort, since it has lower number of swaps.

The idea of the algorithm is to declare the first element as the minumum value and compare it with other elements in the list until we find the one that is lower than it. if so we will change the the minimum label to the lower one and swap it at the end.

It has O(n^2) as its time complexity.
